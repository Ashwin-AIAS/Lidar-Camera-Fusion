## Overview

This project focuses on fusing LiDAR and camera data to enhance perception capabilities for autonomous systems. By combining 3D point cloud data from LiDAR sensors with 2D images from cameras, it improves object detection, localization, and scene understanding.

As the team leader, I oversaw the development and integration of advanced sensor fusion techniques, enabling better environmental awareness for robotics, autonomous vehicles, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
